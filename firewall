WHAT IS A FIREWALL ...?
--> FIREWALL IS A NETWORK SECURITY SYSTEM THAT MONITOR AND CONTROL INCOMMING AND OUTGOING NETWORK TRAFFICE BASED ON THE RULE WE DEFINED
--> BASICALLY USED TO DETERMINE AND BLOCK UNTRUST NETWORK DEVICES 
--> FIREWALL TYPICALLY ESTABLISH A BARRIER BETWEEN A TRUSTED NETWORK AND AN UNTRUSTED NETWORK THROUGH AN INTERNET

TYPES OF FIREWALLS
-------------------
1. SOFTWARE FIREWALL    2.  HARDWARE FIREWALL

1. SOFTWARE FIREWALL
---------------------
--> SOFTWARE FIREWALL SUCH TYPE OF FIREWALL IS A EITHER A OPERATION SYSTEM BULLD-IN (OR) CAN BE ENABLED BY INSTALLATING A SOFTWARE IN THE
COMPUTER SUCH AS EXAMPLE:( ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE, TOTAL PROTECTION SOFTWARE, TOTAL 360 SOFTWARE ETC...) LOT OF SOFTWARE AVAILABLE SOFTWARE 

2.  HARDWARE SOFTWARE
----------------------


A hardware firewall is a physical device designed to protect a network by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on a set of predetermined security rules.
It operates at the network level, filtering packets of data as they pass through it. Unlike software firewalls that run on individual computers or servers, 
hardware firewalls are standalone devices that sit between a local network (such as a LAN) and the broader Internet.

Here are some key characteristics and benefits of hardware firewalls:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    Dedicated Security Appliance: Hardware firewalls are purpose-built devices dedicated solely to the task of network security. They typically come with specialized
    hardware components and software optimized for handling firewall functions.

    Packet Filtering: Hardware firewalls inspect packets of data passing through them and make decisions about whether to allow or block the traffic based on predefined rules.
    These rules can be configured by network administrators to enforce security policies tailored to the organization's needs.

    Stateful Inspection: Many hardware firewalls employ stateful packet inspection (SPI), which keeps track of the state of active connections and makes decisions based on t
    he context of the traffic flow. This helps prevent certain types of attacks, such as those exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols.

    Network Segmentation: Hardware firewalls can be used to segment a network into multiple zones or subnets, each with its own security policies. This helps contain security 
    breaches and limit the spread of malware or unauthorized access within the network.

    Performance: Hardware firewalls are designed to handle high volumes of network traffic efficiently, making them suitable for use in enterprise environments and networks 
    with demanding performance requirements.

    Ease of Management: Hardware firewalls often come with web-based or command-line interfaces that allow administrators to configure and manage firewall rules, 
    monitor network activity, and generate reports on security events.

    Protection for All Devices: Unlike software firewalls that need to be installed and maintained on individual devices, a hardware firewall protects the entire network,
    including devices that may not have their own firewall capabilities, such as IoT devices or networked appliances.

FIREWALL INSTALLATION IN LINUX
--------------------------------
.--> DEFALUT FIREWALL IS INSTALLED IN EVERY LINUX SYSTEM AND WINDOWS ( IN WINDOWS WE GET SOFTWARE ANTIVIRUS,TOTAL SECURITY ETC...)
DEFAULT FIREWALL PATH
----------------------
PATH:/usr/lib/firewalld/
--> IF /USR/LIB DOES NOT CONTAINS FIREWALLD DIRECTORY THEN RUN THE COMMAND 
CMD: yum install firewalld ( it installed firewall )
